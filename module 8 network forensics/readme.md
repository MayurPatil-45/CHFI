# Module 8: Network Forensics 🌐🔍

## Overview

This module focuses on **Network Forensics**, which involves capturing, analyzing, and investigating network traffic to detect security incidents, intrusions, malware communication, and data exfiltration. It helps investigators reconstruct network-based attacks and understand attacker behavior across enterprise networks.

---

## Learning Objectives

* Understand network communication and protocols from a forensic perspective
* Capture and analyze live and recorded network traffic
* Identify malicious traffic and attack patterns
* Perform packet, session, and flow analysis
* Reconstruct network-based incidents and timelines
